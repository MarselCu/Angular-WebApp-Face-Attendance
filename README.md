# Angular-WebApp-Face-Attendance
This repository contains my final project for university in 2023: a web-based attendance system using Angular 2+, Express.js, MySQL, face-api.js, and Geolocation API. The system allows flexible, secure attendance recording via face recognition and location detection.
